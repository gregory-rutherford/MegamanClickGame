# Megaman II Memory Game

__This app is deployed on__ https://gregory-rutherford.github.io/MegamanClickGame/ 

### Stack
* React (create-react-app)
* CSS

#### The Process:

As this is my first React project I wanted to set it up as simply and as separated as possible. All of my stateless functional components are in the components folder and each has a separate CSS file. The `App.js` file contains the main React component that houses all of the logic for the games progression.
